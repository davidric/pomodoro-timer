In IE and Safari, we have to guess source file names\n\t * by searching for function bodies inside all page scripts. This will not\n\t * work for scripts that are loaded cross-domain.\n\t * Here be dragons: some function names may be guessed incorrectly, and\n\t * duplicate functions may be mismatched.\n\t *\n\t * TraceKit.computeStackTrace should only be used for tracing purposes.\n\t * Logging of unhandled exceptions should be done with TraceKit.report,\n\t * which builds on top of TraceKit.computeStackTrace and provides better\n\t * IE support by utilizing the window.onerror event to retrieve information\n\t * about the top of the stack.\n\t *\n\t * Note: In IE and Safari, no stack trace is recorded on the Error object,\n\t * so computeStackTrace instead walks its *own* chain of callers.\n\t * This means that:\n\t *  * in Safari, some methods may be missing from the stack trace;\n\t *  * in IE, the topmost function in the stack trace will always be the\n\t *    caller of computeStackTrace.\n\t *\n\t * This is okay for tracing (because you are likely to be calling\n\t * computeStackTrace from the function you want to be the topmost element\n\t * of the stack trace anyway), but not okay for logging unhandled\n\t * exceptions (because your catch block will likely be far away from the\n\t * inner function that actually caused the exception).\n\t *\n\t */\n\tTraceKit.computeStackTrace = (function computeStackTraceWrapper() {\n\t    var sourceCache = {};\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Attempts to retrieve source code via XMLHttpRequest, which is used\n\t     * to look up anonymous function names.\n\t     * @param {string} url URL of source code.\n\t     * @return {string} Source contents.\n\t     */\n\t    function loadSource(url) {\n\t        if (!TraceKit.remoteFetching) { //Only attempt request if remoteFetching is on.\n\t            return '';\n\t        }\n\t        try {\n\t            var getXHR = function() {\n\t                try {\n\t                    return new window.XMLHttpRequest();\n\t                } catch (e) {\n\t                    // explicitly bubble up the exception if not found\n\t                    return new window.ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP');\n\t                }\n\t            };\n\t\n\t            var request = getXHR();\n\t            request.open('GET', url, false);\n\t            request.send('');\n\t            return request.responseText;\n\t        } catch (e) {\n\t            return '';\n\t        }\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Retrieves source code from the source code cache.\n\t     * @param {string} url URL of source code.\n\t     * @return {Array.<string>} Source contents.\n\t     */\n\t    function getSource(url) {\n\t        if (!isString(url)) return [];\n\t        if (!hasKey(sourceCache, url)) {\n\t            // URL needs to be able to fetched within the acceptable domain.

try { ...code... } catch(ex) { TraceKit.report(ex); }\n *\n * Supports:\n *   - Firefox: full stack trace with line numbers, plus column number\n *              on top frame; column number is not guaranteed\n *   - Opera:   full stack trace with line and column numbers\n *   - Chrome:  full stack trace with line and column numbers\n *   - Safari:  line and column number for the top frame only; some frames\n *              may be missing, and column number is not guaranteed\n *   - IE:      line and column number for the top frame only; some frames\n *              may be missing, and column

tested; versions 9 and earlier may require\n *     Exceptions Have Stacktrace to be enabled in opera:config)\n *   - Safari 3+ (only 4+ tested)\n *   - Chrome 1+ (only 5+ tested)\n *   - Konqueror 3.5+ (untested)\n *\n * Requires TraceKit.computeStackTrace.\n *\n * Tries to catch all unhandled exceptions and report them to the\n * subscribed handlers. Please note that TraceKit.report will rethrow the\n * exception. This is REQUIRED in order to get a useful stack trace in IE.\n * If the exception does not reach the top of the browser, you will only\n * get a stack trace from the point where TraceKit.report was called.\n *\n * Handlers receive a stackInfo object as described in the\n * TraceKit.computeStackTrace docs.\n */\nTraceKit.report = (function reportModuleWrapper() {\n    var handlers = [],\n        lastArgs = null,\n        lastException = null,\n        lastExceptionStack = null;\n\n    /**\n     * Add a crash handler.\n     * @param {Function} handler\n     */\n    function subscribe(handler) {\n        installGlobalHandler();\n        handlers.push(handler);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Remove a crash handler.\n     * @param {Function} handler\n     */\n    function unsubscribe(handler) {\n        for (var i = handlers.length - 1;
